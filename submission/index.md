## Outline ##

This page describes how this blog is built to allow anyone to contribute posts, and describes how to do so.

1. Why you should want to submit a blog post
	1. Speak to people outside of the typical devops community
	2. Speak to leaders and practicioners in the devops space
2. How to submit
	1. Fork my repo on github
	2. Create a markdown file in the _posts folder (following specified naming conventions)
	3. Make a pull request
3. Rules for submission
	1. Opinion pieces are ok
	2. Nothing derogatory, spiteful, or inflammatory (though challenges to established ideas are welcome)
	3. For the most part, don't make pull requests for changes to the blog outside of the _posts folder (though if you really want to improve upon the blog in some objective way, I'm open to it)
