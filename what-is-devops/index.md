## Outline ##

This page has much the same point as my WNIN presentation:

1. To provide a brief introduction of devops, setting up the commonly accepted view of devops as automation of operations tasks and the cooperation of development and operations
2. To challenge and that definition by getting at the heart of what such automation seeks to accomplish
3. To ultimately broaden that definition to align better with the underlying principles of the devops movement
4. To hypothesize some of the types of applications that devops thought can have in other areas of business and life
5. To invite the audience to participate in the conversation, in the post comments and even by contributing to the github repo for the blog (link to the submit a post page)
6. References for further learning
