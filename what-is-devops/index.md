People have been defining and redefining devops for years. The intent here isn't to propose yet another definition, but to try to describe the thinking behind the modern devops movement and to provide a gentle introduction for those of you who are new to the topic. For you seasoned devops professionals, please jump in and correct me if I go astray.

It may be obvious from the word devops&mdash;technically called a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau "Wikipedia"), but I prefer "frankenword"&mdash;that this all started as a way to combine development and operations. To bridge the gap between coders and infra people. But why? What gap are we talking about?

##Build and Release##

At the risk of oversimplifying (and without getting into the historical details, best left to the professionals at [IT Revolution Press](http://itrevolution.com/the-history-of-devops/ "IT Revolution Press")), it's about the old school build and release process, which kind of resembles this:

...

bizdevops came up as early as 2012

1. To provide a brief introduction of devops, setting up the commonly accepted view of devops as automation of operations tasks and the cooperation of development and operations
2. To challenge and that definition by getting at the heart of what such automation seeks to accomplish
3. To ultimately broaden that definition to align better with the underlying principles of the devops movement
4. To hypothesize some of the types of applications that devops thought can have in other areas of business and life
5. To invite the audience to participate in the conversation, in the post comments and even by contributing to the github repo for the blog (link to the submit a post page)
6. References for further learning
