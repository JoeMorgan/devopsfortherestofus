At Sapient Nitro, we're looking at utilizing elements of the devops toolkit to accelerate our work and improve quality and consistency between projects.

## TODO:

In this post I will describe an internal effort, codenamed "Guapo", that we're starting in the Boston XT group. We're doing things like introducing docker for quick, turnkey environment setup, project starter kits which include rich dashboard features out of the box for things like code quality, end to end and unit test, performance analysis, and CSS regression. There are many other features in the works, and by the time this blog post goes live I should have a lot of material to work with.
