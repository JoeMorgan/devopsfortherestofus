As a front-end developer in a digital advertising agency, one of the constraints that I often notice lies at the intersection of development and creative design. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I think devops is the answer.

## TODO:

This post will be the natural extension of the part of my WNIN topic that explores some possible ways to apply devops principles to the exchange of work (and continued collaboration) between design and development. The blog is an opportunity for me to pick up where my presentation leaves off, going further into depth around some of the bottlenecks in our business and the hypothesized tooling that might eventually address those challenges.
