title: Agile Is a Dirty Word

excerpt: "Devops allows for the delivery of functionality that is <em>generated</em> through Agile project administration. So if we're going to look at applying devops principles to other areas of the business, we have to consider how Agile fits in."

Devops and Agile go hand-in-hand. It was at an Agile conference in Toronto that Andrew Shafer and Patrick Debois first got together to talk about what would soon become known as devops, and one could go so far as to say that devops allows for the delivery of functionality that is <em>generated</em> through Agile project administration.

When starting to think about how devops could be applied throughout other areas of the business, it's logical for us to consider what those other disciplines think about Agile. So when I asked a creative director friend how he would feel if said we were going to run the design phase of our project using Agile, he looked something like this:

## Haters Gonna Hate ##

I guess I wasn't surprised; Agile is, after all, a development methodology. But when I started asking some questions to try to get at the why of his response, I realized it wasn't as simple as that. It seems like there's at least a couple of reasons why someone on the creative might react negatively to Agile.

###Goofy Vocabulary###

It may be reductive to say that Agile isn't embraced by non-technologists because it doesn't sound cool. But honestly, "scrum master"? You might as well call it <em>dungeon master</em> for all the good it'll do for Agile's image. Having known a few of the former and many of the latter, it's hard to say who makes out worse with the comparison.

It might be easy to brush off criticisms like this, but remember that these are people for whom image and style are <strong>everything</strong>. A designer will slave for hours over the kerning and leading of a headline, and a copywriter will agonize over the perfect way to tell a user that email address is a required field.

They're paid to know what looks and sounds good, and this is going to make it hard to get them to listen past the words <em>Kanban board</em> when we start talking about applying Agile to their work.

So where does that leave us? Short of creating a separate, creative-friendly lexicon for talking about these things (we could start off by referring to sprints as batches, so people feel at home), I'm not really sure. But this particular problem isn't limited to Agile. You should see the looks I get when I try to talk about this devops with people outside of tech...

###  Misconceptions ###

But let's get back to the conversation with my creative director friend. When asked about Agile, he said something like "Doesn't that just mean that design and dev would be happening at the same time?"

If this is what people think Agile means, then it's no wonder it's so readily dismissed. I'm no Agile expert myself, but having worked on both Agile and waterfall projects over the years, I know which sort I prefer. So let's talk about why.

## Why Bother? ##

The idea of applying Agile to creative projects isn't novel. The folks at smartinsights.com <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/web-project-management/agile-project-process/" target="_blank" title="Agile for digital marketing">wrote about this in 2013</a>, and gave a great example of Agile in action: Oreo's (still) famous <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/02/oreo-twitter-super-bowl/" target="_blank" title="Wired.com - How Oreo Won the Marketing Super Bowl With a Timely Blackout Ad on Twitter">&quot;You can still dunk in the dark&quot;</a> Super Bowl tweet.

But I would go a step further and say that it's not just the impact to business value that Agile (and let's not forget devops) could have on the marketing services side of the house; it's also the impact that it could have for teams and creatives as individuals.

A designer could be working 60 or 70 hours in a week to turn around feedback on the latest comps, only to be told that the client also needs her to to design a PowerPoint deck for an upcoming sales meeting. Because there's no concept of backlog or prioritization, because work isn't estimated or capacity allocated, nine times out of ten the designer just has to suck it up and do the work.

As a developer, I've been in similar situations. When scope isn't controlled and the project is run fast and loose, everyone has to hustle to make up for it. Over the course of a long enough project, the result is tired people, sloppy work, and burnout.

Lucky for me, I think there's little question out there that Agile methodologies pay dividends for development work. I think it's time we share the wealth.

	Has anyone out there ever followed Agile methodologies during the design phase of a project? I'd love to hear some examples in the comments.
