Back in September of 2015, I wrote about [development and design collaboration](/submission/ "development and design collaboration"). In that post, I referenced [my What's Next Is Now presentation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9JRKOPeATo "What's Next Is Now on YouTube") from July of last year, where I talked about a hypothetical tool intended to alleviate constraints found in responsive design workflows.

Unbeknownst to me, it turns out the folks over at [Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/ "Zurb") (makers of the excellent Foundation framework) were working on just such a solution: [Notable Code](http://zurb.com/notable/features/code "Notable Code"). TLDR: It's awesome.

Launched near the end of last year, Notable had almost everything I was looking for: real-time/persisted collaboration between design and dev, breakpoint-specific feedback, and automatic scrolling, resizing, and focusing to recreate the tester's point of view.

At first, it was limited by the fact that you had to upload your code as HTML to their servers in order to benefit from its incredible collaboration and review benefits. But in more recently, it looks like they've added a browser plugin to allow users to capture live sites.

	Have you used Notable Code? I'd be really interested in hearing your impressions. Leave a comment!
