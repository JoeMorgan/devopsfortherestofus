Do you feel like you're on the outside of the devops movement, looking in? Are you excited about automation and measurement as tools to improve the way you work, but you don't typically play in the ops space? This is the place for you. Welcome to Devops for the Rest of Us.

## TODO:

This post serves as an introduction to the blog. It will summarize some of the information from the "What is Devops?" and "About" pages (linking to them in the process for more detail). It will also help to set the voice and tone of the blog, but will be fairly short and somewhat of an atypical post.
