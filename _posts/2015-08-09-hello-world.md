Do you feel like you're on the outside of the devops movement, looking in? Are you excited about automation and measurement as tools to improve the way you work, but you don't typically play in the ops space? This is the place for you. Welcome to Devops for the Rest of Us.

I lead a group of front-end developers at a [digital ad agency](http://sapientnitro.com "SapientNitro.com") in Boston.
