At a glance, Devops for the Rest of Us may seem odd. A devops blog that intentionally shifts the focus <i>away</i> from development and IT operations? What gives?

As a front-end developer learning about devops, I started to see ways that the thinking behind all of the tooling and procedures could be applied within my domain, and in the places where we interact with other disciplines in the organization. The more I understood about the [underlying principles of the devops movement](/what-is-devops/ "What is Devops?"), the more I realized that anyone, from business strategy to finance, from security to creative, would benefit from being a part of this conversation.

There are a hundred places to go for info on the latest in configuration management, continuous integration, or virtual containers. This isn't one of them. Instead, this blog is a place to bounce ideas around and gain new perspectives around agile collaboration.

This isn't to say I wouldn't value input from the mainstream devops community. Far from it! Development and IT operations are just as critical as any element of an organization, and they're the folks with the most experience in applying devops ideas to their work.

So whether you're just learning about devops and you want to share your questions and ideas, or you're a seasoned professional that wishes the rest of the world would work as efficiently as you do, please feel free to engage with this platform.

##About Me##

I'm a Senior Manager of experience technology at <a href="http://www.sapientnitro.com/en-us.html#home" target="_blank" title="SapientNitro.com">SapientNitro</a> in Boston. I'm lucky to help lead a group of incredibly talented developers in an energetic and fast-paced agency environment.

It was through a year-long leadership development program&#8212;called <a href="http://sapientnitroblog.com/tagged/CMTOu" target="_blank" title="Read about Chief Marketing Technology Officer University on the SapientNitro blog">Chief Marketing Technology Officer University</a>&#8212;that I was formally introduced to devops, and it became the topic of my “marketing technology project”, a self-directed course of study that took place over approximately nine months. The culmination of this program took place in Gurgaon, India, where I gave a presentation on devops at Sapient's What’s Next Is Now conference.

After getting a taste for devops, I didn't want my learning to stop when I completed the program. I created Devops for the Rest of Us to continue the conversation I started at What's Next Is Now, and to get others involved in the dialog.

Away from the keyboard, I like to cook, read, travel, and play ping pong.
